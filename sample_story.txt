"Did you see what happened?" Emma asked. "No, what?" David replied quickly.
"The accident on Main Street. Three cars involved." She paused, checking her phone. "My sister was stuck in traffic for an hour."
David frowned. "Was anyone hurt?" he wondered aloud. "I hope not."
"The news says minor injuries only." Emma scrolled through her messages. "Thank goodness."
"We should take the back route tonight," David suggested. "Good idea," Emma agreed.
Meanwhile, across town, Sarah was texting furiously. "Still stuck here!" she wrote. "Traffic isn't moving at all!" Her phone buzzed immediately. "Are you okay?" came the reply from their mother.
"I'm fine, just frustrated." Sarah typed back. "This is taking forever."
"Call me when you get home," their mother responded. "I will," Sarah promised.
