Emma sat by the window, watching the rain streak down the glass. She had been waiting for hours, but David still hadn't called. The fight they'd had that morning kept replaying in her mind.

Meanwhile, across town, David paced his apartment. He wanted to apologize, but his pride kept getting in the way. He picked up his phone three times, only to set it back down.

The storm outside grew stronger. Emma finally closed the curtains and went to bed, her heart heavy with unspoken words. In his apartment, David stared at his phone one last time before turning off the lights.

The next morning, the sun broke through the clouds. Emma woke with a new resolve - she would be the first to reach out. But when she checked her phone, she found a message from David, sent just minutes after she'd fallen asleep: "I'm sorry. Can we talk?"
