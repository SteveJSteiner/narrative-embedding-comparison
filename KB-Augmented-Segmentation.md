## Nano-Experiment on Narrative Segmentation

Standard (simple) methods fail at segmenting narrative well because they lack semantic context. Segmenting narrative has a "chicken and egg" problem because analysis and segmentation may have subtle influences on each other.

My Story Play Code project needs flexible yet accurate narrative segmentation. I plan to decorate text based on that segmentation so if it is not accurate the users will justifiably question the premise.

Here I am trying a kb-triple augmented segmentor. This does a pass with an LLM to find kb-triples over very rough format based segmentation, then re-segments with an LLM that has access to the kb-triples.

My goal is to demonstrate the quality of segmentation I need can be obtained. I have yet to see that so everything else is taking a back seat to finding a solution that could work.

## Technical Approach

The KB-augmented segmentation works in two phases:

**Phase 1: Knowledge Base Extraction**
- Break text into rough segments (sentence-level)
- Extract factual triples: SUBJECT | PREDICATE | OBJECT
- Build contextual relationships between segments

**Phase 2: Context-Informed Re-segmentation**
- Use KB triples to identify semantic boundaries
- Merge or split segments based on relationship continuity
- Prioritize narrative coherence over syntactic boundaries

The prompts and implementation were generated by Claude Sonnet 4 to isolate the algorithmic question from implementation details. This experimental design choice allows us to test whether KB-augmented segmentation fundamentally outperforms standard approaches, independent of prompt engineering or code optimization.

The key insight is that segmentation boundaries should respect relationship contexts - dialogue exchanges, character interactions, and thematic continuity shouldn't be artificially split.

## Implementation Details

**Test Case: Jane Eyre Chapter 1**
I chose Jane Eyre Chapter 1 because it is very effective at narrative transportation.  As a reader, you quickly become immersed in the story. You care about Jane, and by the end you are furious about her circumstances.  How that narrative transportation is accomplished is what I intend Story Code Play to help one see, so this is a required sub-goal.

**Evaluation Methodology:**
I manually analyzed both segmentation outputs to identify qualitatively "bad" segments - those that break narrative coherence, split dialogue exchanges inappropriately, or separate contextually dependent passages.

## Results

**KB-Augmented Segmentation: 36 segments**
**LLM-Only Segmentation: 42 segments**

Pattern Analysis
The KB-augmented segmentation consistently preserves conversational units while the LLM-only approach fragments dialogue exchanges. Three distinct failure modes emerge in the LLM-only segmentation:
1. Question-Response Splitting

LLM-only artificially separates questions from their immediate responses
KB context recognizes these as single conversational units that should remain together
Example: "What does Bessie say I have done?" + response kept as one segment vs. split across two

2. Multi-Turn Dialogue Fragmentation

LLM-only breaks rapid dialogue exchanges into individual utterances
KB triples capture the conversational flow and participant relationships
Example: The curtain interrogation sequence split into 4 micro-segments vs. 2 meaningful units

3. Compound Speech Act Separation

LLM-only splits related exclamations and reactions that form a single emotional response
KB context identifies shared speaker intent and emotional continuity
Example: Mrs. Reed's outburst kept as unified reaction vs. split into separate expressions

Technical Insight:
The KB triples capture speaker relationships and dialogue attribution that inform segmentation boundaries. When the system knows "John asks Jane" followed by "Jane responds to John," it can preserve the conversational unit rather than treating each utterance as an independent text block.
This demonstrates that semantic context about participant relationships is critical for accurate narrative segmentation - the text structure follows the interaction patterns, not just syntactic boundaries.
The core algorithmic improvement: KB-augmented segmentation respects dialogue as social interaction units rather than treating speech as isolated text fragments.

## Technical Limitations

This nano-experiment demonstrates feasibility for dialogue heavy text. It doesn't prove:
- Scalability to full manuscripts
- Generalization across different narrative styles
- Performance characteristics at scale
- Consistency across different LLM providers

The approach currently requires manual evaluation of segment quality, which limits automated validation.

## Conclusion

KB-augmented segmentation shows measurable improvement over standard approaches for narrative text. The technique successfully addresses the co-reliance problem by using contextual information to inform boundary decisions. This provides a foundation for the text decoration features in Story Play Code, and this segmentation approach will enable a modular analysis pipeline where multiple narrative lenses can operate on reliably structured text.

For Story Play Code's narrative visualization features, preserving these conversational units is critical - splitting dialogue exchanges would fragment what should appear as unified dramatic impulses, breaking the gestalt view that makes narrative patterns visible to writers.
